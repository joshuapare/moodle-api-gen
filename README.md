# Moodle API Gen

Autogenerated clients and documentation for the Moodle Webservice API in multiple languages, as well as OpenAPI specs for each version. This project aims to provide a consistent and up-to-date interface for interacting with Moodle's web services by parsing the webservices documentation output into OpenAPI specs and generating clients from them.

The following clients are available:
- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/joshuapare/moodle-client-go)
- [PHP](https://packagist.org/packages/joshuapare/moodle-client-php)
- [NestJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joshuapare/moodle-client-nestjs)
- [TypeScript (Fetch)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joshuapare/moodle-client-ts)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/moodle-client-python)
- [Java](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.joshuapare/moodle-client-java)
- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/moodle-client-rust)
- [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MoodleClientCsharp)

The following documentation is available:
- [Swagger](https://joshuapare.github.io/moodle-api-gen/gen/swagger)

The following definitions are available:
- [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/joshuapare/moodle-api-gen/gen/proto)

In addition to the clients, OpenAPI specs are available for each version of the Moodle API, which can be used to generate clients in other languages or to create custom clients (instructions coming soon).

Due to the nature of the native webservice rest protocol, this requires the [Moodle Webservice API](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Web_service_API) to be enabled on your Moodle site, as well as the [Catalyst RESTful Webservice Plugin](https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-webservice_restful) installed.

## Features

- **Multi-language support**: Clients available for Go, PHP, NestJS, TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust, C#, and more.
- **Generated from OpenAPI specs**: Ensures consistency and up-to-date interfaces with Moodle's API.
- **Versioned for Moodle releases**: Tagged to match the Moodle version they support.

## Creating Moodle Webservice API Tokens

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin.
2. Navigate to `Site administration` > `Plugins` > `Web services` > `Manage tokens`.
3. Click `Add` and select a user.
4. Choose the service for which you want to create a token.
5. Click `Save changes` and copy the generated token.

Use this token in your API client to authenticate requests.
